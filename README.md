- 👋 Hi, I’m @Luis and I am from Atibaia/SP/Brasil 🦜
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 I'm Lilo & Caki's smitten dad 🍼
- 🍉 Love fruits, hate insects 🦗
- 🫘 Java developer on free time, but not a passionate one (no, I will not explain you how a Hashmap is implemented) 🎨
- ⛱ Enthusiast of 'desacelêro' - Portuguese word that refers to slowing down and taking it easy (an unhurried man) 🪂

- 📚 I’m interested in many tech stuff, but currently I am (re)finding myself learning about human sciences (sociology, filosophy and brazillian history) and trying hard to put many of this in the way I see work...

- 🖋 I have also spent some time writing more than code (ptbr only until now): https://medium.com/@lhsantos89

- 📫 How to reach me, take this shortcut: https://www.linkedin.com/in/lhsantos89/
